# Hello, I'm Axel üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer specializing in full-stack development, always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

While I'm not currently contributing to open-source projects, I'm enthusiastic about getting started soon and would love to collaborate with other developers on meaningful and impactful projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me!

## üåü About Me

- üîç I'm currently looking for new opportunities in software development. If you have an exciting role that involves cloud infrastructure, automation, or full-stack development, I'd love to hear about it!
- üå± I‚Äôm currently building my homelab using **Pulumi** and **Kubernetes**, exploring the world of Infrastructure as Code and container orchestration.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I'm a big enthusiast of all things mechanical! Whether it's motorcycles, cars, or anything with an engine, I love to explore and tinker with them. When I'm not in front of a screen, you can often find me working in the fields, helping out on the family farm. Always curious and eager to learn, I love being surrounded by passionate people, sharing stories over a beer, and discovering new things together.
